# LogicEvaluatorTree
Gets a composed logical statement and tests how each entry in a set is evaluating against that statement. 
Also plots the statement as a tree.

I made this while thinking about a search engine for posts on a blog. Each post has tags and categories and I wanted a search functionality that lets me compose logical statements to query the entries for matches.
Just a prototype in this form. For instance you can change stuff, but leave spaces in the logical statement, otherwise it won't be interpreted correctly.
